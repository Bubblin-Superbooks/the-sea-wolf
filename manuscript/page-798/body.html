<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Next day, the mast-steps clear and everything in readiness, we started to get the two topmasts aboard.&nbsp; The maintopmast was over thirty feet in length, the foretopmast nearly thirty, and it was of these that I intended making the shears.&nbsp; It was puzzling work.&nbsp; Fastening one end of a heavy tackle to the windlass, and with the other end fast to the butt of the foretopmast, I began to heave.&nbsp; Maud held the turn on the windlass and coiled down the slack.</p><p>We were astonished at the ease with which the spar was lifted.&nbsp; It was an improved crank windlass, and the purchase it gave was enormous.&nbsp; Of course, what it gave us in power we paid for in distance; as many times as it doubled my strength, that many times was doubled the length of rope I heaved in.</p></div> </div>
