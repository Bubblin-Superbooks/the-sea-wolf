<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; No man less than a giant could have done what he did, once he had gained the foot of the ladder.&nbsp; Step by step, by the might of his arms, the whole pack of men striving to drag him back and down, he drew his body up from the floor till he stood erect.&nbsp; And then, step by step, hand and foot, he slowly struggled up the ladder.</p><p>The very last of all, I saw.&nbsp; For Latimer, having finally gone for a lantern, held it so that its light shone down the scuttle.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen was nearly to the top, though I could not see him.&nbsp; All that was visible was the mass of men fastened upon him.&nbsp; It squirmed about, like some huge many-legged spider, and swayed back and forth to the regular roll of the vessel.&nbsp; And still, step by step with long intervals between, the mass ascended.&nbsp; Once it tottered, about to fall back, but the broken hold was regained and it still went up.</p></div> </div>
