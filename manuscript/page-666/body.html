<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In three hours&mdash;it was midnight, I well remember, and as dark as I had ever seen it on the sea&mdash;the wind, still blowing out of the south-west, rose furiously, and once again I was compelled to set the sea-anchor.</p><p>Day broke and found me wan-eyed and the ocean lashed white, the boat pitching, almost on end, to its drag.&nbsp; We were in imminent danger of being swamped by the whitecaps.&nbsp; As it was, spray and spume came aboard in such quantities that I bailed without cessation.&nbsp; The blankets were soaking.&nbsp; Everything was wet except Maud, and she, in oilskins, rubber boots, and sou&rsquo;wester, was dry, all but her face and hands and a stray wisp of hair.&nbsp; She relieved me at the bailing-hole from time to time, and bravely she threw out the water and faced the storm.&nbsp; All things are relative.</p></div> </div>
