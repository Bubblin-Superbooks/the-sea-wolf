<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What freak of fortune had brought it here&mdash;here of all spots? what chance of chances?&nbsp; I looked at the bleak, inaccessible wall at my back and know the profundity of despair.&nbsp; Escape was hopeless, out of the question.&nbsp; I thought of Maud, asleep there in the hut we had reared; I remembered her &ldquo;Good-night, Humphrey&rdquo;; &ldquo;my woman, my mate,&rdquo; went ringing through my brain, but now, alas, it was a knell that sounded.&nbsp; Then everything went black before my eyes.</p><p>Possibly it was the fraction of a second, but I had no knowledge of how long an interval had lapsed before I was myself again.&nbsp; There lay the Ghost, bow on to the beach, her splintered bowsprit projecting over the sand, her tangled spars rubbing against her side to the lift of the crooning waves.&nbsp; Something must be done, must be done.</p></div> </div>
