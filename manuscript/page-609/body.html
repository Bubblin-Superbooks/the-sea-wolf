<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;Miss Brewster is right in contending that temptation is temptation whether the man yield or overcome.&nbsp; Fire is fanned by the wind until it leaps up fiercely.&nbsp; So is desire like fire.&nbsp; It is fanned, as by a wind, by sight of the thing desired, or by a new and luring description or comprehension of the thing desired.&nbsp; There lies the temptation.&nbsp; It is the wind that fans the desire until it leaps up to mastery.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s temptation.&nbsp; It may not fan sufficiently to make the desire overmastering, but in so far as it fans at all, that far is it temptation.&nbsp; And, as you say, it may tempt for good as well as for evil.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
