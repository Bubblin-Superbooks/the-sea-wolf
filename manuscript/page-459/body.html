<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Back we held, two miles and more to windward of the struggling cockle-shell, when the flying jib was run down and the schooner hove to.&nbsp; The sealing boats are not made for windward work.&nbsp; Their hope lies in keeping a weather position so that they may run before the wind for the schooner when it breezes up.&nbsp; But in all that wild waste there was no refuge for Leach and Johnson save on the Ghost, and they resolutely began the windward beat.&nbsp; It was slow work in the heavy sea that was running.&nbsp; At any moment they were liable to be overwhelmed by the hissing combers.&nbsp; Time and again and countless times we watched the boat luff into the big whitecaps, lose headway, and be flung back like a cork.</p></div> </div>
