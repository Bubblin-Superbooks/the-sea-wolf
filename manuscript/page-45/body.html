<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A cheap cotton shirt, with frayed collar and a bosom discoloured with what I took to be ancient blood-stains, was put on me amid a running and apologetic fire of comment.&nbsp; A pair of workman&rsquo;s brogans encased my feet, and for trousers I was furnished with a pair of pale blue, washed-out overalls, one leg of which was fully ten inches shorter than the other.&nbsp; The abbreviated leg looked as though the devil had there clutched for the Cockney&rsquo;s soul and missed the shadow for the substance.</p><p>&ldquo;And whom have I to thank for this kindness?&rdquo; I asked, when I stood completely arrayed, a tiny boy&rsquo;s cap on my head, and for coat a dirty, striped cotton jacket which ended at the small of my back and the sleeves of which reached just below my elbows.</p></div> </div>
