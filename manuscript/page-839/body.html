<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; There was a way in which it could be done, and it remained for me to find that way.</p><p>While I was considering the problem, Wolf Larsen came on deck.&nbsp; We noticed something strange about him at once.&nbsp; The indecisiveness, or feebleness, of his movements was more pronounced.&nbsp; His walk was actually tottery as he came down the port side of the cabin.&nbsp; At the break of the poop he reeled, raised one hand to his eyes with the familiar brushing gesture, and fell down the steps&mdash;still on his feet&mdash;to the main deck, across which he staggered, falling and flinging out his arms for support.&nbsp; He regained his balance by the steerage companion-way and stood there dizzily for a space, when he suddenly crumpled up and collapsed, his legs bending under him as he sank to the deck.</p></div> </div>
