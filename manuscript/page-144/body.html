<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew,&mdash;Louis he is called, a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman, and a very sociable fellow, prone to talk as long as he can find a listener.&nbsp; In the afternoon, while the cook was below asleep and I was peeling the everlasting potatoes, Louis dropped into the galley for a &ldquo;yarn.&rdquo;&nbsp; His excuse for being aboard was that he was drunk when he signed.&nbsp; He assured me again and again that it was the last thing in the world he would dream of doing in a sober moment.&nbsp; It seems that he has been seal-hunting regularly each season for a dozen years, and is accounted one of the two or three very best boat-steerers in both fleets.</p></div> </div>
