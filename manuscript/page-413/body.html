<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I looked for the boat, and, while Wolf Larsen cleared the boat-tackles, saw it lift to leeward on a big sea an not a score of feet away.&nbsp; And, so nicely had he made his calculation, we drifted fairly down upon it, so that nothing remained to do but hook the tackles to either end and hoist it aboard.&nbsp; But this was not done so easily as it is written.</p><p>In the bow was Kerfoot, Oofty-Oofty in the stern, and Kelly amidships.&nbsp; As we drifted closer the boat would rise on a wave while we sank in the trough, till almost straight above me I could see the heads of the three men craned overside and looking down.&nbsp; Then, the next moment, we would lift and soar upward while they sank far down beneath us.&nbsp; It seemed incredible that the next surge should not crush the Ghost down upon the tiny eggshell.</p></div> </div>
