<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O the blazing tropic night, when the wake&rsquo;s a welt of light &nbsp;&nbsp; That holds the hot sky tame, And the steady forefoot snores through the planet-powdered floors &nbsp;&nbsp; Where the scared whale flukes in flame. Her plates are scarred by the sun, dear lass, &nbsp;&nbsp; And her ropes are taut with the dew, For we&rsquo;re booming down on the old trail, our own trail, the out trail, &nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;re sagging south on the Long Trail&mdash;the trail that is always new.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Eh, Hump?&nbsp; How&rsquo;s it strike you?&rdquo; he asked, after the due pause which words and setting demanded.</p></div> </div>
