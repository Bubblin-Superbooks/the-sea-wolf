<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When I returned on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering mainly with one hand, while with the other hand he held the marine glasses and studied the situation of the boats, paying particular attention to the position of the Macedonia.&nbsp; The only change noticeable in our boats was that they had hauled close on the wind and were heading several points west of north.&nbsp; Still, I could not see the expediency of the man&oelig;uvre, for the free sea was still intercepted by the Macedonia&rsquo;s five weather boats, which, in turn, had hauled close on the wind.&nbsp; Thus they slowly diverged toward the west, drawing farther away from the remainder of the boats in their line.&nbsp; Our boats were rowing as well as sailing.&nbsp; Even the hunters were pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy.</p></div> </div>
