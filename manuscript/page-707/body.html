<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I had used eight shells for lighting fires before I hit upon the device of banking the embers with wet moss, and there remained not over a hundred shells in the box.</p><p>&ldquo;We must club the seals,&rdquo; I announced, when convinced of my poor marksmanship.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have heard the sealers talk about clubbing them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They are so pretty,&rdquo; she objected.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot bear to think of it being done.&nbsp; It is so directly brutal, you know; so different from shooting them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That roof must go on,&rdquo; I answered grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Winter is almost here.&nbsp; It is our lives against theirs.&nbsp; It is unfortunate we haven&rsquo;t plenty of ammunition, but I think, anyway, that they suffer less from being clubbed than from being all shot up.&nbsp; Besides, I shall do the clubbing.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
