<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I saw more of Wolf Larsen than ever when we had gained the grounds.&nbsp; For when the weather was fair and we were in the midst of the herd, all hands were away in the boats, and left on board were only he and I, and Thomas Mugridge, who did not count.&nbsp; But there was no play about it.&nbsp; The six boats, spreading out fan-wise from the schooner until the first weather boat and the last lee boat were anywhere from ten to twenty miles apart, cruised along a straight course over the sea till nightfall or bad weather drove them in.&nbsp; It was our duty to sail the Ghost well to leeward of the last lee boat, so that all the boats should have fair wind to run for us in case of squalls or threatening weather.</p></div> </div>
