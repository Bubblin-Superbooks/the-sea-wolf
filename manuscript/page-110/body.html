<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I had lived a placid, uneventful, sedentary existence all my days&mdash;the life of a scholar and a recluse on an assured and comfortable income.&nbsp; Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.&nbsp; I had always been a book-worm; so my sisters and father had called me during my childhood.&nbsp; I had gone camping but once in my life, and then I left the party almost at its start and returned to the comforts and conveniences of a roof.&nbsp; And here I was, with dreary and endless vistas before me of table-setting, potato-peeling, and dish-washing.&nbsp; And I was not strong.&nbsp; The doctors had always said that I had a remarkable constitution, but I had never developed it or my body through exercise.&nbsp; My muscles were small and soft, like a woman&rsquo;s, or so the doctors had said time and again in the course of their attempts to persuade me to go in for physical-culture fads.</p></div> </div>
