<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;May God damn your soul to hell, Wolf Larsen, only hell&rsquo;s too good for you, you coward, you murderer, you pig!&rdquo; was his opening salutation.</p><p>I was thunderstruck.&nbsp; I looked for his instant annihilation.&nbsp; But it was not Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s whim to annihilate him.&nbsp; He sauntered slowly forward to the break of the poop, and, leaning his elbow on the corner of the cabin, gazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited boy.</p><p>And the boy indicted Wolf Larsen as he had never been indicted before.&nbsp; The sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside the forecastle scuttle and watched and listened.&nbsp; The hunters piled pell-mell out of the steerage, but as Leach&rsquo;s tirade continued I saw that there was no levity in their faces.&nbsp; Even they were frightened, not at the boy&rsquo;s terrible words, but at his terrible audacity.</p></div> </div>
