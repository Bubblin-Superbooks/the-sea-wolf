<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It was a strength I had not possessed a few months before, on the day I said good-bye to Charley Furuseth and started for San Francisco on the ill-fated Martinez.</p><p>As the boat ascended on a sea, her feet touched and I released her hands.&nbsp; I cast off the tackles and leaped after her.&nbsp; I had never rowed in my life, but I put out the oars and at the expense of much effort got the boat clear of the Ghost.&nbsp; Then I experimented with the sail.&nbsp; I had seen the boat-steerers and hunters set their spritsails many times, yet this was my first attempt.&nbsp; What took them possibly two minutes took me twenty, but in the end I succeeded in setting and trimming it, and with the steering-oar in my hands hauled on the wind.</p></div> </div>
