<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I turned aside, caught my breath, and looked again.&nbsp; The wave over-topped the Ghost, and I gazed sheer up and into it.&nbsp; A shaft of sunlight smote the over-curl, and I caught a glimpse of translucent, rushing green, backed by a milky smother of foam.</p><p>Then it descended, pandemonium broke loose, everything happened at once.&nbsp; I was struck a crushing, stunning blow, nowhere in particular and yet everywhere.&nbsp; My hold had been broken loose, I was under water, and the thought passed through my mind that this was the terrible thing of which I had heard, the being swept in the trough of the sea.&nbsp; My body struck and pounded as it was dashed helplessly along and turned over and over, and when I could hold my breath no longer, I breathed the stinging salt water into my lungs.</p></div> </div>
