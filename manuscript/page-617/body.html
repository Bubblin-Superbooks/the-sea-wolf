<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It was inevitable that Milton&rsquo;s Lucifer should be instanced, and the keenness with which Wolf Larsen analysed and depicted the character was a revelation of his stifled genius.&nbsp; It reminded me of Taine, yet I knew the man had never heard of that brilliant though dangerous thinker.</p><p>&ldquo;He led a lost cause, and he was not afraid of God&rsquo;s thunderbolts,&rdquo; Wolf Larsen was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurled into hell, he was unbeaten.&nbsp; A third of God&rsquo;s angels he had led with him, and straightway he incited man to rebel against God, and gained for himself and hell the major portion of all the generations of man.&nbsp; Why was he beaten out of heaven?&nbsp; Because he was less brave than God? less proud? less aspiring?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; A thousand times no!&nbsp; God was more powerful, as he said, Whom thunder hath made greater.&nbsp; But Lucifer was a free spirit.</p></div> </div>
