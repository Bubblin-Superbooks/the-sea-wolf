<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When I emerged on deck it seemed that the end of everything had come.&nbsp; On all sides there was a rending and crashing of wood and steel and canvas.&nbsp; The Ghost was being wrenched and torn to fragments.&nbsp; The foresail and fore-topsail, emptied of the wind by the man&oelig;uvre, and with no one to bring in the sheet in time, were thundering into ribbons, the heavy boom threshing and splintering from rail to rail.&nbsp; The air was thick with flying wreckage, detached ropes and stays were hissing and coiling like snakes, and down through it all crashed the gaff of the foresail.</p><p>The spar could not have missed me by many inches, while it spurred me to action.&nbsp; Perhaps the situation was not hopeless.&nbsp; I remembered Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s caution.&nbsp; He had expected all hell to break loose, and here it was.</p></div> </div>
