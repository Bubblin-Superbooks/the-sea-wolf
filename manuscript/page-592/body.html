<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; And at once, as in an instant&rsquo;s leap, the sun was blotted out, there was no sky, even our mastheads were lost to view, and our horizon was such as tear-blinded eyes may see.&nbsp; The grey mist drove by us like a rain.&nbsp; Every woollen filament of our garments, every hair of our heads and faces, was jewelled with a crystal globule.&nbsp; The shrouds were wet with moisture; it dripped from our rigging overhead; and on the underside of our booms drops of water took shape in long swaying lines, which were detached and flung to the deck in mimic showers at each surge of the schooner.&nbsp; I was aware of a pent, stifled feeling.&nbsp; As the sounds of the ship thrusting herself through the waves were hurled back upon us by the fog, so were one&rsquo;s thoughts.&nbsp; The mind recoiled from contemplation of a world beyond this wet veil which wrapped us around.</p></div> </div>
