<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It has dawned upon me that I have never placed a proper valuation upon womankind.&nbsp; For that matter, though not amative to any considerable degree so far as I have discovered, I was never outside the atmosphere of women until now.&nbsp; My mother and sisters were always about me, and I was always trying to escape them; for they worried me to distraction with their solicitude for my health and with their periodic inroads on my den, when my orderly confusion, upon which I prided myself, was turned into worse confusion and less order, though it looked neat enough to the eye.&nbsp; I never could find anything when they had departed.&nbsp; But now, alas, how welcome would have been the feel of their presence, the frou-frou and swish-swish of their skirts which I had so cordially detested!&nbsp; I am sure, if I ever get home, that I shall never be irritable with them again.</p></div> </div>
