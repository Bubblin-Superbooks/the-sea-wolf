<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two hours of terrible work followed, in which all hands of us&mdash;two hunters, three sailors, Wolf Larsen and I&mdash;reefed, first one and then the other, the jib and mainsail.&nbsp; Hove to under this short canvas, our decks were comparatively free of water, while the Ghost bobbed and ducked amongst the combers like a cork.</p><p>I had burst open the ends of my fingers at the very first, and during the reefing I had worked with tears of pain running down my cheeks.&nbsp; And when all was done, I gave up like a woman and rolled upon the deck in the agony of exhaustion.</p><p>In the meantime Thomas Mugridge, like a drowned rat, was being dragged out from under the forecastle head where he had cravenly ensconced himself.&nbsp; I saw him pulled aft to the cabin, and noted with a shock of surprise that the galley had disappeared.&nbsp; A clean space of deck showed where it had stood.</p></div> </div>
