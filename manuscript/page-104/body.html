<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>That night, when I had finished an endless amount of work, I was sent to sleep in the steerage, where I made up a spare bunk.&nbsp; I was glad to get out of the detestable presence of the cook and to be off my feet.&nbsp; To my surprise, my clothes had dried on me and there seemed no indications of catching cold, either from the last soaking or from the prolonged soaking from the foundering of the Martinez.&nbsp; Under ordinary circumstances, after all that I had undergone, I should have been fit for bed and a trained nurse.</p><p>But my knee was bothering me terribly.&nbsp; As well as I could make out, the kneecap seemed turned up on edge in the midst of the swelling.&nbsp; As I sat in my bunk examining it (the six hunters were all in the steerage, smoking and talking in loud voices), Henderson took a passing glance at it.</p></div> </div>
