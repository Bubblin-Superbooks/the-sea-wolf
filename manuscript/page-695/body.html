<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Watch me,&rdquo; I said.</p><p>From under clefts among the rocks I gathered a few dry sticks and chips.&nbsp; These I whittled into shavings or split into kindling.&nbsp; From my note-book I tore out a page, and from the ammunition box took a shot-gun shell.&nbsp; Removing the wads from the latter with my knife, I emptied the powder on a flat rock.&nbsp; Next I pried the primer, or cap, from the shell, and laid it on the rock, in the midst of the scattered powder.&nbsp; All was ready.&nbsp; Maud still watched from the tent.&nbsp; Holding the paper in my left hand, I smashed down upon the cap with a rock held in my right.&nbsp; There was a puff of white smoke, a burst of flame, and the rough edge of the paper was alight.</p></div> </div>
