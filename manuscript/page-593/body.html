<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; This was the world, the universe itself, its bounds so near one felt impelled to reach out both arms and push them back.&nbsp; It was impossible, that the rest could be beyond these walls of grey.&nbsp; The rest was a dream, no more than the memory of a dream.</p><p>It was weird, strangely weird.&nbsp; I looked at Maud Brewster and knew that she was similarly affected.&nbsp; Then I looked at Wolf Larsen, but there was nothing subjective about his state of consciousness.&nbsp; His whole concern was with the immediate, objective present.&nbsp; He still held the wheel, and I felt that he was timing Time, reckoning the passage of the minutes with each forward lunge and leeward roll of the Ghost.</p></div> </div>
