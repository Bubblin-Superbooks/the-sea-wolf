<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When I knocked the shackle-bolt loose, the chain roared out through the hawse-hole and into the sea.&nbsp; I raced aft, putting the wheel up.&nbsp; The Ghost seemed to start into life as she heeled to the first fill of her sails.&nbsp; The jib was rising.&nbsp; As it filled, the Ghost&rsquo;s bow swung off and I had to put the wheel down a few spokes and steady her.</p><p>I had devised an automatic jib-sheet which passed the jib across of itself, so there was no need for Maud to attend to that; but she was still hoisting the jib when I put the wheel hard down.&nbsp; It was a moment of anxiety, for the Ghost was rushing directly upon the beach, a stone&rsquo;s throw distant.&nbsp; But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.</p></div> </div>
