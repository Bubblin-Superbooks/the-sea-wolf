<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; In some way, when Harrison was aloft, the sheet jammed in the block through which it runs at the end of the gaff.&nbsp; As I understood it, there were two ways of getting it cleared,&mdash;first, by lowering the foresail, which was comparatively easy and without danger; and second, by climbing out the peak-halyards to the end of the gaff itself, an exceedingly hazardous performance.</p><p>Johansen called out to Harrison to go out the halyards.&nbsp; It was patent to everybody that the boy was afraid.&nbsp; And well he might be, eighty feet above the deck, to trust himself on those thin and jerking ropes.&nbsp; Had there been a steady breeze it would not have been so bad, but the Ghost was rolling emptily in a long sea, and with each roll the canvas flapped and boomed and the halyards slacked and jerked taut.&nbsp; They were capable of snapping a man off like a fly from a whip-lash.</p></div> </div>
