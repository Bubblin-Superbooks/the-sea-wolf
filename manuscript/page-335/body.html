<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It smelled sour and musty, and by the dim light of the swinging sea-lamp I saw every bit of available wall-space hung deep with sea-boots, oilskins, and garments, clean and dirty, of various sorts.&nbsp; These swung back and forth with every roll of the vessel, giving rise to a brushing sound, as of trees against a roof or wall.&nbsp; Somewhere a boot thumped loudly and at irregular intervals against the wall; and, though it was a mild night on the sea, there was a continual chorus of the creaking timbers and bulkheads and of abysmal noises beneath the flooring.</p><p>The sleepers did not mind.&nbsp; There were eight of them,&mdash;the two watches below,&mdash;and the air was thick with the warmth and odour of their breathing, and the ear was filled with the noise of their snoring and of their sighs and half-groans, tokens plain of the rest of the animal-man.</p></div> </div>
