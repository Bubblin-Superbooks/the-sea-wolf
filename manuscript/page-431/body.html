<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; As for Wolf Larsen and myself, we got along fairly well; though I could not quite rid myself of the idea that right conduct, for me, lay in killing him.&nbsp; He fascinated me immeasurably, and I feared him immeasurably.&nbsp; And yet, I could not imagine him lying prone in death.&nbsp; There was an endurance, as of perpetual youth, about him, which rose up and forbade the picture.&nbsp; I could see him only as living always, and dominating always, fighting and destroying, himself surviving.</p><p>One diversion of his, when we were in the midst of the herd and the sea was too rough to lower the boats, was to lower with two boat-pullers and a steerer and go out himself.&nbsp; He was a good shot, too, and brought many a skin aboard under what the hunters termed impossible hunting conditions.</p></div> </div>
