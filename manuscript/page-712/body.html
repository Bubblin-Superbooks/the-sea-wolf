<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull in the midst of his wives.&nbsp; I was armed with the regular club with which the boat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters.&nbsp; It was only a foot and a half long, and in my superb ignorance I never dreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured four to five feet.&nbsp; The cows lumbered out of my way, and the distance between me and the bull decreased.&nbsp; He raised himself on his flippers with an angry movement.&nbsp; We were a dozen feet apart.&nbsp; Still I advanced steadily, looking for him to turn tail at any moment and run.</p><p>At six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind, What if he will not run?&nbsp; Why, then I shall club him, came the answer.</p></div> </div>
