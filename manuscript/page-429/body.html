<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Two of our boats, with men all safe, we took off the Cisco, and, to Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s huge delight and my own grief, he culled Smoke, with Nilson and Leach, from the San Diego.&nbsp; So that, at the end of five days, we found ourselves short but four men&mdash;Henderson, Holyoak, Williams, and Kelly,&mdash;and were once more hunting on the flanks of the herd.</p><p>As we followed it north we began to encounter the dreaded sea-fogs.&nbsp; Day after day the boats lowered and were swallowed up almost ere they touched the water, while we on board pumped the horn at regular intervals and every fifteen minutes fired the bomb gun.&nbsp; Boats were continually being lost and found, it being the custom for a boat to hunt, on lay, with whatever schooner picked it up, until such time it was recovered by its own schooner.</p></div> </div>
