<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Maud had sunk down upon the deck and was, I knew, lying motionless, her body in the shadow of the bulwark.&nbsp; But the man never turned, and, after stretching his arms above his head and yawning audibly, he retraced his steps to the forecastle scuttle and disappeared.</p><p>A few minutes sufficed to finish the loading, and I lowered the boat into the water.&nbsp; As I helped Maud over the rail and felt her form close to mine, it was all I could do to keep from crying out, &ldquo;I love you!&nbsp; I love you!&rdquo;&nbsp; Truly Humphrey Van Weyden was at last in love, I thought, as her fingers clung to mine while I lowered her down to the boat.&nbsp; I held on to the rail with one hand and supported her weight with the other, and I was proud at the moment of the feat.</p></div> </div>
