<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>After a sleepless night, I arose weak and in agony, to hobble through my second day on the Ghost.&nbsp; Thomas Mugridge routed me out at half-past five, much in the fashion that Bill Sykes must have routed out his dog; but Mr. Mugridge&rsquo;s brutality to me was paid back in kind and with interest.&nbsp; The unnecessary noise he made (I had lain wide-eyed the whole night) must have awakened one of the hunters; for a heavy shoe whizzed through the semi-darkness, and Mr. Mugridge, with a sharp howl of pain, humbly begged everybody&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp; Later on, in the galley, I noticed that his ear was bruised and swollen.&nbsp; It never went entirely back to its normal shape, and was called a &ldquo;cauliflower ear&rdquo; by the sailors.</p></div> </div>
