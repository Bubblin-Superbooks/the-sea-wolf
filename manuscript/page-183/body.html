<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Johnson seems to spend all his spare time there or aloft at the crosstrees, watching the Ghost cleaving the water under press of sail.&nbsp; There is passion, adoration, in his eyes, and he goes about in a sort of trance, gazing in ecstasy at the swelling sails, the foaming wake, and the heave and the run of her over the liquid mountains that are moving with us in stately procession.</p><p>The days and nights are &ldquo;all a wonder and a wild delight,&rdquo; and though I have little time from my dreary work, I steal odd moments to gaze and gaze at the unending glory of what I never dreamed the world possessed.&nbsp; Above, the sky is stainless blue&mdash;blue as the sea itself, which under the forefoot is of the colour and sheen of azure satin.</p></div> </div>
