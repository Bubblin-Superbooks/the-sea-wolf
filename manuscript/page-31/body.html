<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I tried to reach it, in a mad resolve to claw into the wood with my nails, but my arms were heavy and lifeless.&nbsp; Again I strove to call out, but made no sound.</p><p>The stern of the vessel shot by, dropping, as it did so, into a hollow between the waves; and I caught a glimpse of a man standing at the wheel, and of another man who seemed to be doing little else than smoke a cigar.&nbsp; I saw the smoke issuing from his lips as he slowly turned his head and glanced out over the water in my direction.&nbsp; It was a careless, unpremeditated glance, one of those haphazard things men do when they have no immediate call to do anything in particular, but act because they are alive and must do something.</p></div> </div>
