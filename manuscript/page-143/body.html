<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Wolf Larsen has, also, a reputation for reckless carrying on of sail.&nbsp; I overheard Henderson and another of the hunters, Standish, a Californian, talking about it.&nbsp; Two years ago he dismasted the Ghost in a gale on Bering Sea, whereupon the present masts were put in, which are stronger and heavier in every way.&nbsp; He is said to have remarked, when he put them in, that he preferred turning her over to losing the sticks.</p><p>Every man aboard, with the exception of Johansen, who is rather overcome by his promotion, seems to have an excuse for having sailed on the Ghost.&nbsp; Half the men forward are deep-water sailors, and their excuse is that they did not know anything about her or her captain.&nbsp; And those who do know, whisper that the hunters, while excellent shots, were so notorious for their quarrelsome and rascally proclivities that they could not sign on any decent schooner.</p></div> </div>
