<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Once, the terror of this giddy sweep overpowered me, and for a while I clung on, hand and foot, weak and trembling, unable to search the sea for the missing boats or to behold aught of the sea but that which roared beneath and strove to overwhelm the Ghost.</p><p>But the thought of the men in the midst of it steadied me, and in my quest for them I forgot myself.&nbsp; For an hour I saw nothing but the naked, desolate sea.&nbsp; And then, where a vagrant shaft of sunlight struck the ocean and turned its surface to wrathful silver, I caught a small black speck thrust skyward for an instant and swallowed up.&nbsp; I waited patiently.&nbsp; Again the tiny point of black projected itself through the wrathful blaze a couple of points off our port-bow.&nbsp; I did not attempt to shout, but communicated the news to Wolf Larsen by waving my arm.&nbsp; He changed the course, and I signalled affirmation when the speck showed dead ahead.</p></div> </div>
