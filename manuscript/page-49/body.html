<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Beyond a sailor at the wheel who stared curiously across the top of the cabin, I attracted no notice whatever.</p><p>Everybody seemed interested in what was going on amid ships.&nbsp; There, on a hatch, a large man was lying on his back.&nbsp; He was fully clothed, though his shirt was ripped open in front.&nbsp; Nothing was to be seen of his chest, however, for it was covered with a mass of black hair, in appearance like the furry coat of a dog.&nbsp; His face and neck were hidden beneath a black beard, intershot with grey, which would have been stiff and bushy had it not been limp and draggled and dripping with water.&nbsp; His eyes were closed, and he was apparently unconscious; but his mouth was wide open, his breast, heaving as though from suffocation as he laboured noisily for breath.</p></div> </div>
