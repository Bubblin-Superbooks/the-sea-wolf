<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I called to her, and the mast moved easily and accurately.&nbsp; Straight toward the square hole of the step the square butt descended; but as it descended it slowly twisted so that square would not fit into square.&nbsp; But I had not even a moment&rsquo;s indecision.&nbsp; Calling to Maud to cease lowering, I went on deck and made the watch-tackle fast to the mast with a rolling hitch.&nbsp; I left Maud to pull on it while I went below.&nbsp; By the light of the lantern I saw the butt twist slowly around till its sides coincided with the sides of the step.&nbsp; Maud made fast and returned to the windlass.&nbsp; Slowly the butt descended the several intervening inches, at the same time slightly twisting again.&nbsp; Again Maud rectified the twist with the watch-tackle, and again she lowered away from the windlass.&nbsp; Square fitted into square.&nbsp; The mast was stepped.</p></div> </div>
