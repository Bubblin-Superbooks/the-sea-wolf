<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ten knots, twelve knots, eleven knots, varying from time to time, is the speed we are making.&nbsp; And ever out of the north-east the brave wind blows, driving us on our course two hundred and fifty miles between the dawns.&nbsp; It saddens me and gladdens me, the gait with which we are leaving San Francisco behind and with which we are foaming down upon the tropics.&nbsp; Each day grows perceptibly warmer.&nbsp; In the second dog-watch the sailors come on deck, stripped, and heave buckets of water upon one another from overside.&nbsp; Flying-fish are beginning to be seen, and during the night the watch above scrambles over the deck in pursuit of those that fall aboard.&nbsp; In the morning, Thomas Mugridge being duly bribed, the galley is pleasantly areek with the odour of their frying; while dolphin meat is served fore and aft on such occasions as Johnson catches the blazing beauties from the bowsprit end.</p></div> </div>
