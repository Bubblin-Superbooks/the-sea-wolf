<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The last twenty-four hours have witnessed a carnival of brutality.&nbsp; From cabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion.&nbsp; I scarcely know where to begin.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen was really the cause of it.&nbsp; The relations among the men, strained and made tense by feuds, quarrels and grudges, were in a state of unstable equilibrium, and evil passions flared up in flame like prairie-grass.</p><p>Thomas Mugridge is a sneak, a spy, an informer.&nbsp; He has been attempting to curry favour and reinstate himself in the good graces of the captain by carrying tales of the men forward.&nbsp; He it was, I know, that carried some of Johnson&rsquo;s hasty talk to Wolf Larsen.&nbsp; Johnson, it seems, bought a suit of oilskins from the slop-chest and found them to be of greatly inferior quality.&nbsp; Nor was he slow in advertising the fact.</p></div> </div>
