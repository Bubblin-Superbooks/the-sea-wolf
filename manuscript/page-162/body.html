<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Outlined against the clear blue of the sky, he had the appearance of an enormous spider crawling along the tracery of its web.</p><p>It was a slight uphill climb, for the foresail peaked high; and the halyards, running through various blocks on the gaff and mast, gave him separate holds for hands and feet.&nbsp; But the trouble lay in that the wind was not strong enough nor steady enough to keep the sail full.&nbsp; When he was half-way out, the Ghost took a long roll to windward and back again into the hollow between two seas.&nbsp; Harrison ceased his progress and held on tightly.&nbsp; Eighty feet beneath, I could see the agonized strain of his muscles as he gripped for very life.&nbsp; The sail emptied and the gaff swung amid-ships.&nbsp; The halyards slackened, and, though it all happened very quickly, I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body.</p></div> </div>
