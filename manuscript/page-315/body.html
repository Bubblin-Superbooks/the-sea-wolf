<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Several days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and went about his work in a half-hearted way.&nbsp; He was still a sick man, and I more than once observed him creeping painfully aloft to a topsail, or drooping wearily as he stood at the wheel.&nbsp; But, still worse, it seemed that his spirit was broken.&nbsp; He was abject before Wolf Larsen and almost grovelled to Johansen.&nbsp; Not so was the conduct of Leach.&nbsp; He went about the deck like a tiger cub, glaring his hatred openly at Wolf Larsen and Johansen.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do for you yet, you slab-footed Swede,&rdquo; I heard him say to Johansen one night on deck.</p></div> </div>
