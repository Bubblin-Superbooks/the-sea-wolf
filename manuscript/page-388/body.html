<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> masts, ropes, and rails spattered with the sanguinary colour; and the men, like butchers plying their trade, naked and red of arm and hand, hard at work with ripping and flensing-knives, removing the skins from the pretty sea-creatures they had killed.</p><p>It was my task to tally the pelts as they came aboard from the boats, to oversee the skinning and afterward the cleansing of the decks and bringing things ship-shape again.&nbsp; It was not pleasant work.&nbsp; My soul and my stomach revolted at it; and yet, in a way, this handling and directing of many men was good for me.&nbsp; It developed what little executive ability I possessed, and I was aware of a toughening or hardening which I was undergoing and which could not be anything but wholesome for &ldquo;Sissy&rdquo; Van Weyden.</p></div> </div>
