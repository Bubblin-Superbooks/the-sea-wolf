<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>While on the question of vagaries, I shall tell what befell Thomas Mugridge in the cabin, and at the same time complete an incident upon which I have already touched once or twice.&nbsp; The twelve o&rsquo;clock dinner was over, one day, and I had just finished putting the cabin in order, when Wolf Larsen and Thomas Mugridge descended the companion stairs.&nbsp; Though the cook had a cubby-hole of a state-room opening off from the cabin, in the cabin itself he had never dared to linger or to be seen, and he flitted to and fro, once or twice a day, a timid spectre.</p><p>&ldquo;So you know how to play &lsquo;Nap,&rsquo;&rdquo; Wolf Larsen was saying in a pleased sort of voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might have guessed an Englishman would know.&nbsp; I learned it myself in English ships.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
