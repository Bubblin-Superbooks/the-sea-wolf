<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The Ghost was deserted.&nbsp; It was Maud&rsquo;s and mine.&nbsp; I thought of the ship&rsquo;s stores and the lazarette beneath the cabin, and the idea came to me of surprising Maud with something nice for breakfast.</p><p>The reaction from my fear, and the knowledge that the terrible deed I had come to do was no longer necessary, made me boyish and eager.&nbsp; I went up the steerage companion-way two steps at a time, with nothing distinct in my mind except joy and the hope that Maud would sleep on until the surprise breakfast was quite ready for her.&nbsp; As I rounded the galley, a new satisfaction was mine at thought of all the splendid cooking utensils inside.&nbsp; I sprang up the break of the poop, and saw&mdash;Wolf Larsen.&nbsp; What of my impetus and the stunning surprise, I clattered three or four steps along the deck before I could stop myself.</p></div> </div>
