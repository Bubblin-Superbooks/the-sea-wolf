<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; A sailor, from time to time and quite methodically, as a matter of routine, dropped a canvas bucket into the ocean at the end of a rope, hauled it in hand under hand, and sluiced its contents over the prostrate man.</p><p>Pacing back and forth the length of the hatchways and savagely chewing the end of a cigar, was the man whose casual glance had rescued me from the sea.&nbsp; His height was probably five feet ten inches, or ten and a half; but my first impression, or feel of the man, was not of this, but of his strength.&nbsp; And yet, while he was of massive build, with broad shoulders and deep chest, I could not characterize his strength as massive.&nbsp; It was what might be termed a sinewy, knotty strength, of the kind we ascribe to lean and wiry men, but which, in him, because of his heavy build, partook more of the enlarged gorilla order.</p></div> </div>
