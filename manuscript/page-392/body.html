<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I remember one beautiful day, when the boats left early and the reports of the hunters&rsquo; guns grew dim and distant and died away as they scattered far and wide over the sea.&nbsp; There was just the faintest wind from the westward; but it breathed its last by the time we managed to get to leeward of the last lee boat.&nbsp; One by one&mdash;I was at the masthead and saw&mdash;the six boats disappeared over the bulge of the earth as they followed the seal into the west.&nbsp; We lay, scarcely rolling on the placid sea, unable to follow.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen was apprehensive.&nbsp; The barometer was down, and the sky to the east did not please him.&nbsp; He studied it with unceasing vigilance.</p></div> </div>
