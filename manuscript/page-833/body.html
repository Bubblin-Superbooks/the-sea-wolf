<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>In half a day I got the two topmasts aboard and the shears rigged and guyed as before.&nbsp; And that night I slept on board and on deck beside my work.&nbsp; Maud, who refused to stay alone ashore, slept in the forecastle.&nbsp; Wolf Larsen had sat about, listening to my repairing the windlass and talking with Maud and me upon indifferent subjects.&nbsp; No reference was made on either side to the destruction of the shears; nor did he say anything further about my leaving his ship alone.&nbsp; But still I had feared him, blind and helpless and listening, always listening, and I never let his strong arms get within reach of me while I worked.</p><p>On this night, sleeping under my beloved shears, I was aroused by his footsteps on the deck.&nbsp; It was a starlight night, and I could see the bulk of him dimly as he moved about.</p></div> </div>
