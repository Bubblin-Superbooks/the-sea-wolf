<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Later in the morning I received a surprise of a totally different sort.&nbsp; Following the cook&rsquo;s instructions, I had gone into Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s state-room to put it to rights and make the bed.&nbsp; Against the wall, near the head of the bunk, was a rack filled with books.&nbsp; I glanced over them, noting with astonishment such names as Shakespeare, Tennyson, Poe, and De Quincey.&nbsp; There were scientific works, too, among which were represented men such as Tyndall, Proctor, and Darwin.&nbsp; Astronomy and physics were represented, and I remarked Bulfinch&rsquo;s Age of Fable, Shaw&rsquo;s History of English and American Literature, and Johnson&rsquo;s Natural History in two large volumes.&nbsp; Then there were a number of grammars, such as Metcalf&rsquo;s, and Reed and Kellogg&rsquo;s; and I smiled as I saw a copy of The Dean&rsquo;s English.</p></div> </div>
