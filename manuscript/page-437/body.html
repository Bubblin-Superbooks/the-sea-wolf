<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I know that I slipped down into the steerage in a daze, and that I was just beginning the ascent to the deck, a loaded shot-gun in my hands, when I heard the startled cry:</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s five men in that boat!&rdquo;</p><p>I supported myself in the companion-way, weak and trembling, while the observation was being verified by the remarks of the rest of the men.&nbsp; Then my knees gave from under me and I sank down, myself again, but overcome by shock at knowledge of what I had so nearly done.&nbsp; Also, I was very thankful as I put the gun away and slipped back on deck.</p></div> </div>
