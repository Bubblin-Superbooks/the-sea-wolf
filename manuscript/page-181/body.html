<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At last, after three days of variable winds, we have caught the north-east trades.&nbsp; I came on deck, after a good night&rsquo;s rest in spite of my poor knee, to find the Ghost foaming along, wing-and-wing, and every sail drawing except the jibs, with a fresh breeze astern.&nbsp; Oh, the wonder of the great trade-wind!&nbsp; All day we sailed, and all night, and the next day, and the next, day after day, the wind always astern and blowing steadily and strong.&nbsp; The schooner sailed herself.&nbsp; There was no pulling and hauling on sheets and tackles, no shifting of topsails, no work at all for the sailors to do except to steer.&nbsp; At night when the sun went down, the sheets were slackened; in the morning, when they yielded up the damp of the dew and relaxed, they were pulled tight again&mdash;and that was all.</p></div> </div>
