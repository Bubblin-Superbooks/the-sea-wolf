<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Sometimes I think Wolf Larsen mad, or half-mad at least, what of his strange moods and vagaries.&nbsp; At other times I take him for a great man, a genius who has never arrived.&nbsp; And, finally, I am convinced that he is the perfect type of the primitive man, born a thousand years or generations too late and an anachronism in this culminating century of civilization.&nbsp; He is certainly an individualist of the most pronounced type.&nbsp; Not only that, but he is very lonely.&nbsp; There is no congeniality between him and the rest of the men aboard ship.&nbsp; His tremendous virility and mental strength wall him apart.&nbsp; They are more like children to him, even the hunters, and as children he treats them, descending perforce to their level and playing with them as a man plays with puppies.</p></div> </div>
