<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Look at him, Hump,&rdquo; Wolf Larsen said to me, &ldquo;look at this bit of animated dust, this aggregation of matter that moves and breathes and defies me and thoroughly believes itself to be compounded of something good; that is impressed with certain human fictions such as righteousness and honesty, and that will live up to them in spite of all personal discomforts and menaces.&nbsp; What do you think of him, Hump?&nbsp; What do you think of him?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I think that he is a better man than you are,&rdquo; I answered, impelled, somehow, with a desire to draw upon myself a portion of the wrath I felt was about to break upon his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;His human fictions, as you choose to call them, make for nobility and manhood.&nbsp; You have no fictions, no dreams, no ideals.&nbsp; You are a pauper.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
