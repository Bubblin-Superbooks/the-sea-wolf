<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I remembered the life-preservers stored in the cabin, but was met at the door and swept backward by a wild rush of men and women.&nbsp; What happened in the next few minutes I do not recollect, though I have a clear remembrance of pulling down life-preservers from the overhead racks, while the red-faced man fastened them about the bodies of an hysterical group of women.&nbsp; This memory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen.&nbsp; It is a picture, and I can see it now,&mdash;the jagged edges of the hole in the side of the cabin, through which the grey fog swirled and eddied; the empty upholstered seats, littered with all the evidences of sudden flight, such as packages, hand satchels, umbrellas, and wraps;</p></div> </div>
