<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The forecastle scuttle was open.&nbsp; I paused to listen for the breathing of the men, but there was no breathing.&nbsp; I almost gasped as the thought came to me: What if the Ghost is deserted?&nbsp; I listened more closely.&nbsp; There was no sound.&nbsp; I cautiously descended the ladder.&nbsp; The place had the empty and musty feel and smell usual to a dwelling no longer inhabited.&nbsp; Everywhere was a thick litter of discarded and ragged garments, old sea-boots, leaky oilskins&mdash;all the worthless forecastle dunnage of a long voyage.</p><p>Abandoned hastily, was my conclusion, as I ascended to the deck.&nbsp; Hope was alive again in my breast, and I looked about me with greater coolness.&nbsp; I noted that the boats were missing.&nbsp; The steerage told the same tale as the forecastle.&nbsp; The hunters had packed their belongings with similar haste.</p></div> </div>
