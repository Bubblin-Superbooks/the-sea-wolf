<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thomas Mugridge is cur-like in his subjection to me, while I go about in secret dread of him.&nbsp; His is the courage of fear,&mdash;a strange thing I know well of myself,&mdash;and at any moment it may master the fear and impel him to the taking of my life.&nbsp; My knee is much better, though it often aches for long periods, and the stiffness is gradually leaving the arm which Wolf Larsen squeezed.&nbsp; Otherwise I am in splendid condition, feel that I am in splendid condition.&nbsp; My muscles are growing harder and increasing in size.&nbsp; My hands, however, are a spectacle for grief.&nbsp; They have a parboiled appearance, are afflicted with hang-nails, while the nails are broken and discoloured, and the edges of the quick seem to be assuming a fungoid sort of growth.&nbsp; Also, I am suffering from boils, due to the diet, most likely, for I was never afflicted in this manner before.</p></div> </div>
