<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>My hands bothered me a great deal, unused as they were to work.&nbsp; The nails were discoloured and black, while the skin was already grained with dirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove.&nbsp; Then blisters came, in a painful and never-ending procession, and I had a great burn on my forearm, acquired by losing my balance in a roll of the ship and pitching against the galley stove.&nbsp; Nor was my knee any better.&nbsp; The swelling had not gone down, and the cap was still up on edge.&nbsp; Hobbling about on it from morning till night was not helping it any.&nbsp; What I needed was rest, if it were ever to get well.</p><p>Rest!&nbsp; I never before knew the meaning of the word.&nbsp; I had been resting all my life and did not know it.</p></div> </div>
