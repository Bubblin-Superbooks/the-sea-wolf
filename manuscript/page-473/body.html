<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Wolf Larsen had little to say at first, doing no more than reply when he was addressed.&nbsp; Not that he was abashed.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; This woman was a new type to him, a different breed from any he had ever known, and he was curious.&nbsp; He studied her, his eyes rarely leaving her face unless to follow the movements of her hands or shoulders.&nbsp; I studied her myself, and though it was I who maintained the conversation, I know that I was a bit shy, not quite self-possessed.&nbsp; His was the perfect poise, the supreme confidence in self, which nothing could shake; and he was no more timid of a woman than he was of storm and battle.</p></div> </div>
