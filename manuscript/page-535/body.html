<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Furuseth was right; I was abnormal, an &ldquo;emotionless monster,&rdquo; a strange bookish creature, capable of pleasuring in sensations only of the mind.&nbsp; And though I had been surrounded by women all my days, my appreciation of them had been &aelig;sthetic and nothing more.&nbsp; I had actually, at times, considered myself outside the pale, a monkish fellow denied the eternal or the passing passions I saw and understood so well in others.&nbsp; And now it had come!&nbsp; Undreamed of and unheralded, it had come.&nbsp; In what could have been no less than an ecstasy, I left my post at the head of the companion-way and started along the deck, murmuring to myself those beautiful lines of Mrs. Browning:</p><p>&ldquo;I lived with visions for my company Instead of men and women years ago, And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know A sweeter music than they played to me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
