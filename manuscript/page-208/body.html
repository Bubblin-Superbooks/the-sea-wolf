<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; With immortality before me, altruism would be a paying business proposition.&nbsp; I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes.&nbsp; But with nothing eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell this yeasty crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice.&nbsp; Any sacrifice that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish,&mdash;and not only foolish, for it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing.&nbsp; I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am to get the most out of the ferment.&nbsp; Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was yeasty and acrawl.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
