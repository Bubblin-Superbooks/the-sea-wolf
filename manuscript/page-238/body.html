<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I see Cooky&rsquo;s finish,&rdquo; I heard Smoke say to Horner.</p><p>&ldquo;You bet,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hump runs the galley from now on, and Cooky pulls in his horns.&rdquo;</p><p>Mugridge heard and shot a swift glance at me, but I gave no sign that the conversation had reached me.&nbsp; I had not thought my victory was so far-reaching and complete, but I resolved to let go nothing I had gained.&nbsp; As the days went by, Smoke&rsquo;s prophecy was verified.&nbsp; The Cockney became more humble and slavish to me than even to Wolf Larsen.&nbsp; I mistered him and sirred him no longer, washed no more greasy pots, and peeled no more potatoes.&nbsp; I did my own work, and my own work only, and when and in what fashion I saw fit.</p></div> </div>
