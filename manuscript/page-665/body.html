<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There is no need of going into an extended recital of our suffering in the small boat during the many days we were driven and drifted, here and there, willy-nilly, across the ocean.&nbsp; The high wind blew from the north-west for twenty-four hours, when it fell calm, and in the night sprang up from the south-west.&nbsp; This was dead in our teeth, but I took in the sea-anchor and set sail, hauling a course on the wind which took us in a south-south-easterly direction.&nbsp; It was an even choice between this and the west-north-westerly course which the wind permitted; but the warm airs of the south fanned my desire for a warmer sea and swayed my decision.</p></div> </div>
