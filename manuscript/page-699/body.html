<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; High up on the beach of the second cove from ours, we discovered the splintered wreck of a boat&mdash;a sealer&rsquo;s boat, for the rowlocks were bound in sennit, a gun-rack was on the starboard side of the bow, and in white letters was faintly visible Gazelle No. 2.&nbsp; The boat had lain there for a long time, for it was half filled with sand, and the splintered wood had that weather-worn appearance due to long exposure to the elements.&nbsp; In the stern-sheets I found a rusty ten-gauge shot-gun and a sailor&rsquo;s sheath-knife broken short across and so rusted as to be almost unrecognizable.</p><p>&ldquo;They got away,&rdquo; I said cheerfully; but I felt a sinking at the heart and seemed to divine the presence of bleached bones somewhere on that beach.</p></div> </div>
