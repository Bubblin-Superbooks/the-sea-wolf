<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It is no slight matter for two men, particularly when a stiff wind has sprung up, to handle a vessel like the Ghost, steering, keeping look-out for the boats, and setting or taking in sail; so it devolved upon me to learn, and learn quickly.&nbsp; Steering I picked up easily, but running aloft to the crosstrees and swinging my whole weight by my arms when I left the ratlines and climbed still higher, was more difficult.&nbsp; This, too, I learned, and quickly, for I felt somehow a wild desire to vindicate myself in Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s eyes, to prove my right to live in ways other than of the mind.&nbsp; Nay, the time came when I took joy in the run of the masthead and in the clinging on by my legs at that precarious height while I swept the sea with glasses in search of the boats.</p></div> </div>
