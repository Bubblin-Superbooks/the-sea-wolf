<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; All around the horizon are pale, fleecy clouds, never changing, never moving, like a silver setting for the flawless turquoise sky.</p><p>I do not forget one night, when I should have been asleep, of lying on the forecastle-head and gazing down at the spectral ripple of foam thrust aside by the Ghost&rsquo;s forefoot.&nbsp; It sounded like the gurgling of a brook over mossy stones in some quiet dell, and the crooning song of it lured me away and out of myself till I was no longer Hump the cabin-boy, nor Van Weyden, the man who had dreamed away thirty-five years among books.&nbsp; But a voice behind me, the unmistakable voice of Wolf Larsen, strong with the invincible certitude of the man and mellow with appreciation of the words he was quoting, aroused me.</p></div> </div>
