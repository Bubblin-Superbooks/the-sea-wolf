<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The worst of the storm must have blown that night, though little I noticed it.&nbsp; I had succumbed and slept where I sat in the stern-sheets.&nbsp; The morning of the fourth day found the wind diminished to a gentle whisper, the sea dying down and the sun shining upon us.&nbsp; Oh, the blessed sun!&nbsp; How we bathed our poor bodies in its delicious warmth, reviving like bugs and crawling things after a storm.&nbsp; We smiled again, said amusing things, and waxed optimistic over our situation.&nbsp; Yet it was, if anything, worse than ever.&nbsp; We were farther from Japan than the night we left the Ghost.&nbsp; Nor could I more than roughly guess our latitude and longitude.&nbsp; At a calculation of a two-mile drift per hour, during the seventy and odd hours of the storm, we had been driven at least one hundred and fifty miles to the north-east.</p></div> </div>
