<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Several days went by, the Ghost still foaming down the trades, and I could swear I saw madness growing in Thomas Mugridge&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; And I confess that I became afraid, very much afraid.&nbsp; Whet, whet, whet, it went all day long.&nbsp; The look in his eyes as he felt the keen edge and glared at me was positively carnivorous.&nbsp; I was afraid to turn my shoulder to him, and when I left the galley I went out backwards&mdash;to the amusement of the sailors and hunters, who made a point of gathering in groups to witness my exit.&nbsp; The strain was too great.&nbsp; I sometimes thought my mind would give way under it&mdash;a meet thing on this ship of madmen and brutes.&nbsp; Every hour, every minute of my existence was in jeopardy.&nbsp; I was a human soul in distress, and yet no soul, fore or aft, betrayed sufficient sympathy to come to my aid.</p></div> </div>
