<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>As he told me, the Ghost is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably fine model.&nbsp; Her beam, or width, is twenty-three feet, and her length a little over ninety feet.&nbsp; A lead keel of fabulous but unknown weight makes her very stable, while she carries an immense spread of canvas.&nbsp; From the deck to the truck of the maintopmast is something over a hundred feet, while the foremast with its topmast is eight or ten feet shorter.&nbsp; I am giving these details so that the size of this little floating world which holds twenty-two men may be appreciated.&nbsp; It is a very little world, a mote, a speck, and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a contrivance so small and fragile.</p></div> </div>
