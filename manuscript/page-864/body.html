<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I profited by my lesson learned through raising the shears and then climbing them to attach the guys.&nbsp; To the top of the foremast, which was just lifted conveniently from the deck, I attached the rigging, stays and throat and peak halyards.&nbsp; As usual, I had underrated the amount of work involved in this portion of the task, and two long days were necessary to complete it.&nbsp; And there was so much yet to be done&mdash;the sails, for instance, which practically had to be made over.</p><p>While I toiled at rigging the foremast, Maud sewed on canvas, ready always to drop everything and come to my assistance when more hands than two were required.&nbsp; The canvas was heavy and hard, and she sewed with the regular sailor&rsquo;s palm and three-cornered sail-needle.</p></div> </div>
