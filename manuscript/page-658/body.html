<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The wind freshened in the afternoon, raising a stiffer sea and trying the boat and me severely.&nbsp; But the supply of food and the nine breakers of water enabled the boat to stand up to the sea and wind, and I held on as long as I dared.&nbsp; Then I removed the sprit, tightly hauling down the peak of the sail, and we raced along under what sailors call a leg-of-mutton.</p><p>Late in the afternoon I sighted a steamer&rsquo;s smoke on the horizon to leeward, and I knew it either for a Russian cruiser, or, more likely, the Macedonia still seeking the Ghost.&nbsp; The sun had not shone all day, and it had been bitter cold.&nbsp; As night drew on, the clouds darkened and the wind freshened, so that when Maud and I ate supper it was with our mittens on and with me still steering and eating morsels between puffs.</p></div> </div>
