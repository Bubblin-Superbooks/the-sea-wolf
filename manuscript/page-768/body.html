<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A week of this passed by.&nbsp; We had no other interest than Wolf Larsen, and his presence weighed us down with an apprehension which prevented us from doing any of the little things we had planned.</p><p>But at the end of the week the smoke ceased rising from the galley, and he no longer showed himself on the poop.&nbsp; I could see Maud&rsquo;s solicitude again growing, though she timidly&mdash;and even proudly, I think&mdash;forbore a repetition of her request.&nbsp; After all, what censure could be put upon her?&nbsp; She was divinely altruistic, and she was a woman.&nbsp; Besides, I was myself aware of hurt at thought of this man whom I had tried to kill, dying alone with his fellow-creatures so near.&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; The code of my group was stronger than I.&nbsp; The fact that he had hands, feet, and a body shaped somewhat like mine, constituted a claim which I could not ignore.</p></div> </div>
