<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Once more the Ghost bore away before the storm, this time so submerging herself that for some seconds I thought she would never reappear.&nbsp; Even the wheel, quite a deal higher than the waist, was covered and swept again and again.&nbsp; At such moments I felt strangely alone with God, alone with him and watching the chaos of his wrath.&nbsp; And then the wheel would reappear, and Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s broad shoulders, his hands gripping the spokes and holding the schooner to the course of his will, himself an earth-god, dominating the storm, flinging its descending waters from him and riding it to his own ends.&nbsp; And oh, the marvel of it! the marvel of it!&nbsp; That tiny men should live and breathe and work, and drive so frail a contrivance of wood and cloth through so tremendous an elemental strife.</p></div> </div>
