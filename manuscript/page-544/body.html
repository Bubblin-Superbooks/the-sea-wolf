<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The hunting promised to be profitable.&nbsp; We had sailed since daylight across a sea barren of seals, and were now running into the herd.</p><p>The smoke was still miles astern, but overhauling us rapidly, when we lowered our boats.&nbsp; They spread out and struck a northerly course across the ocean.&nbsp; Now and again we saw a sail lower, heard the reports of the shot-guns, and saw the sail go up again.&nbsp; The seals were thick, the wind was dying away; everything favoured a big catch.&nbsp; As we ran off to get our leeward position of the last lee boat, we found the ocean fairly carpeted with sleeping seals.&nbsp; They were all about us, thicker than I had ever seen them before, in twos and threes and bunches, stretched full length on the surface and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy young dogs.</p></div> </div>
