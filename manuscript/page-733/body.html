<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The beaches of the outer cove were thundering with the surf, and even in our land-locked inner cove a respectable sea was breaking.&nbsp; No high backbone of island sheltered us from the wind, and it whistled and bellowed about the hut till at times I feared for the strength of the walls.&nbsp; The skin roof, stretched tightly as a drumhead, I had thought, sagged and bellied with every gust; and innumerable interstices in the walls, not so tightly stuffed with moss as Maud had supposed, disclosed themselves.&nbsp; Yet the seal-oil burned brightly and we were warm and comfortable.</p><p>It was a pleasant evening indeed, and we voted that as a social function on Endeavour Island it had not yet been eclipsed.&nbsp; Our minds were at ease.&nbsp; Not only had we resigned ourselves to the bitter winter, but we were prepared for it.</p></div> </div>
