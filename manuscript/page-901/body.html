<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I was stiff and lame, and cried out with pain when the bed-clothes touched my poor finger-ends.</p><p>Morning had evidently not come, so I closed my eyes and went to sleep again.&nbsp; I did not know it, but I had slept the clock around and it was night again.</p><p>Once more I woke, troubled because I could sleep no better.&nbsp; I struck a match and looked at my watch.&nbsp; It marked midnight.&nbsp; And I had not left the deck until three!&nbsp; I should have been puzzled had I not guessed the solution.&nbsp; No wonder I was sleeping brokenly.&nbsp; I had slept twenty-one hours.&nbsp; I listened for a while to the behaviour of the Ghost, to the pounding of the seas and the muffled roar of the wind on deck, and then turned over on my side and slept peacefully until morning.</p></div> </div>
