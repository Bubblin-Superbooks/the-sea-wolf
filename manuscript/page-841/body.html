<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Maud shook her head, and there was reproof in her eyes.&nbsp; But just then the wrist I held leaped from my hand, and the hand clasped like a steel trap about my wrist.&nbsp; I cried aloud in awful fear, a wild inarticulate cry; and I caught one glimpse of his face, malignant and triumphant, as his other hand compassed my body and I was drawn down to him in a terrible grip.</p><p>My wrist was released, but his other arm, passed around my back, held both my arms so that I could not move.&nbsp; His free hand went to my throat, and in that moment I knew the bitterest foretaste of death earned by one&rsquo;s own idiocy.&nbsp; Why had I trusted myself within reach of those terrible arms?&nbsp; I could feel other hands at my throat.&nbsp; They were Maud&rsquo;s hands, striving vainly to tear loose the hand that was throttling me.</p></div> </div>
