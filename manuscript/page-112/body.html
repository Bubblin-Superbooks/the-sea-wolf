<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>And all the while, rolling, plunging, climbing the moving mountains and falling and wallowing in the foaming valleys, the schooner Ghost was fighting her way farther and farther into the heart of the Pacific&mdash;and I was on her.&nbsp; I could hear the wind above.&nbsp; It came to my ears as a muffled roar.&nbsp; Now and again feet stamped overhead.&nbsp; An endless creaking was going on all about me, the woodwork and the fittings groaning and squeaking and complaining in a thousand keys.&nbsp; The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed.&nbsp; The air was filled with oaths and indecent expressions.&nbsp; I could see their faces, flushed and angry, the brutality distorted and emphasized by the sickly yellow of the sea-lamps which rocked back and forth with the ship.&nbsp; Through the dim smoke-haze the bunks looked like the sleeping dens of animals in a menagerie.</p></div> </div>
