<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Men fight and struggle ferociously for one another&rsquo;s lives.&nbsp; The hunters are looking for a shooting scrape at any moment between Smoke and Henderson, whose old quarrel has not healed, while Wolf Larsen says positively that he will kill the survivor of the affair, if such affair comes off.&nbsp; He frankly states that the position he takes is based on no moral grounds, that all the hunters could kill and eat one another so far as he is concerned, were it not that he needs them alive for the hunting.&nbsp; If they will only hold their hands until the season is over, he promises them a royal carnival, when all grudges can he settled and the survivors may toss the non-survivors overboard and arrange a story as to how the missing men were lost at sea.&nbsp; I think even the hunters are appalled at his cold-bloodedness.&nbsp; Wicked men though they be, they are certainly very much afraid of him.</p></div> </div>
