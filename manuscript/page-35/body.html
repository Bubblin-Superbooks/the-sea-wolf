<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I seemed swinging in a mighty rhythm through orbit vastness.&nbsp; Sparkling points of light spluttered and shot past me.&nbsp; They were stars, I knew, and flaring comets, that peopled my flight among the suns.&nbsp; As I reached the limit of my swing and prepared to rush back on the counter swing, a great gong struck and thundered.&nbsp; For an immeasurable period, lapped in the rippling of placid centuries, I enjoyed and pondered my tremendous flight.</p><p>But a change came over the face of the dream, for a dream I told myself it must be.&nbsp; My rhythm grew shorter and shorter.&nbsp; I was jerked from swing to counter swing with irritating haste.&nbsp; I could scarcely catch my breath, so fiercely was I impelled through the heavens.&nbsp; The gong thundered more frequently and more furiously.&nbsp; I grew to await it with a nameless dread.</p></div> </div>
