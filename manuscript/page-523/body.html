<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Brave winds, blowing fair, swiftly drove the Ghost northward into the seal herd.&nbsp; We encountered it well up to the forty-fourth parallel, in a raw and stormy sea across which the wind harried the fog-banks in eternal flight.&nbsp; For days at a time we could never see the sun nor take an observation; then the wind would sweep the face of the ocean clean, the waves would ripple and flash, and we would learn where we were.&nbsp; A day of clear weather might follow, or three days or four, and then the fog would settle down upon us, seemingly thicker than ever.</p><p>The hunting was perilous; yet the boats, lowered day after day, were swallowed up in the grey obscurity, and were seen no more till nightfall, and often not till long after, when they would creep in like sea-wraiths, one by one, out of the grey.</p></div> </div>
