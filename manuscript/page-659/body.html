<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>By the time it was dark, wind and sea had become too strong for the boat, and I reluctantly took in the sail and set about making a drag or sea-anchor.&nbsp; I had learned of the device from the talk of the hunters, and it was a simple thing to manufacture.&nbsp; Furling the sail and lashing it securely about the mast, boom, sprit, and two pairs of spare oars, I threw it overboard.&nbsp; A line connected it with the bow, and as it floated low in the water, practically unexposed to the wind, it drifted less rapidly than the boat.&nbsp; In consequence it held the boat bow on to the sea and wind&mdash;the safest position in which to escape being swamped when the sea is breaking into whitecaps.</p></div> </div>
