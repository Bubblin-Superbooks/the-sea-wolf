<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I made no complaint, but Wolf Larsen demanded the most punctilious sea etiquette in my case,&mdash;far more than poor Johansen had ever received; and at the expense of several rows, threats, and much grumbling, he brought the hunters to time.&nbsp; I was &ldquo;Mr. Van Weyden&rdquo; fore and aft, and it was only unofficially that Wolf Larsen himself ever addressed me as &ldquo;Hump.&rdquo;</p><p>It was amusing.&nbsp; Perhaps the wind would haul a few points while we were at dinner, and as I left the table he would say, &ldquo;Mr. Van Weyden, will you kindly put about on the port tack.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I would go on deck, beckon Louis to me, and learn from him what was to be done.&nbsp; Then, a few minutes later, having digested his instructions and thoroughly mastered the man&oelig;uvre, I would proceed to issue my orders.</p></div> </div>
