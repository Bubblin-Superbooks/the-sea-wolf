<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>On the morning of the third day, shortly after eight bells, a cry that the boat was sighted came down from Smoke at the masthead.&nbsp; All hands lined the rail.&nbsp; A snappy breeze was blowing from the west with the promise of more wind behind it; and there, to leeward, in the troubled silver of the rising sun, appeared and disappeared a black speck.</p><p>We squared away and ran for it.&nbsp; My heart was as lead.&nbsp; I felt myself turning sick in anticipation; and as I looked at the gleam of triumph in Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s eyes, his form swam before me, and I felt almost irresistibly impelled to fling myself upon him.&nbsp; So unnerved was I by the thought of impending violence to Leach and Johnson that my reason must have left me.</p></div> </div>
