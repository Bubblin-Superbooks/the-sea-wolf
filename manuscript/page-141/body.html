<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>All this, and more, I have learned.&nbsp; The Ghost is considered the fastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets.&nbsp; In fact, she was once a private yacht, and was built for speed.&nbsp; Her lines and fittings&mdash;though I know nothing about such things&mdash;speak for themselves.&nbsp; Johnson was telling me about her in a short chat I had with him during yesterday&rsquo;s second dog-watch.&nbsp; He spoke enthusiastically, with the love for a fine craft such as some men feel for horses.&nbsp; He is greatly disgusted with the outlook, and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen bears a very unsavoury reputation among the sealing captains.&nbsp; It was the Ghost herself that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage, but he is already beginning to repent.</p></div> </div>
