<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; It is the darkness of death, the ceasing to be, the ceasing to feel, the ceasing to move, that is gathering about you, descending upon you, rising around you.&nbsp; Your eyes are becoming set.&nbsp; They are glazing.&nbsp; My voice sounds faint and far.&nbsp; You cannot see my face.&nbsp; And still you struggle in my grip.&nbsp; You kick with your legs.&nbsp; Your body draws itself up in knots like a snake&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Your chest heaves and strains.&nbsp; To live!&nbsp; To live!&nbsp; To live&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>I heard no more.&nbsp; Consciousness was blotted out by the darkness he had so graphically described, and when I came to myself I was lying on the floor and he was smoking a cigar and regarding me thoughtfully with that old familiar light of curiosity in his eyes.</p></div> </div>
