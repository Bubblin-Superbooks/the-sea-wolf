<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; But now, could I sit still for one half-hour and do nothing, not even think, it would be the most pleasurable thing in the world.&nbsp; But it is a revelation, on the other hand.&nbsp; I shall be able to appreciate the lives of the working people hereafter.&nbsp; I did not dream that work was so terrible a thing.&nbsp; From half-past five in the morning till ten o&rsquo;clock at night I am everybody&rsquo;s slave, with not one moment to myself, except such as I can steal near the end of the second dog-watch.&nbsp; Let me pause for a minute to look out over the sea sparkling in the sun, or to gaze at a sailor going aloft to the gaff-topsails, or running out the bowsprit, and I am sure to hear the hateful voice, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, you, &rsquo;Ump, no sodgerin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got my peepers on yer.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
