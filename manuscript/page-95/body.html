<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What happened to me next on the sealing-schooner Ghost, as I strove to fit into my new environment, are matters of humiliation and pain.&nbsp; The cook, who was called &ldquo;the doctor&rdquo; by the crew, &ldquo;Tommy&rdquo; by the hunters, and &ldquo;Cooky&rdquo; by Wolf Larsen, was a changed person.&nbsp; The difference worked in my status brought about a corresponding difference in treatment from him.&nbsp; Servile and fawning as he had been before, he was now as domineering and bellicose.&nbsp; In truth, I was no longer the fine gentleman with a skin soft as a &ldquo;lydy&rsquo;s,&rdquo; but only an ordinary and very worthless cabin-boy.</p><p>He absurdly insisted upon my addressing him as Mr. Mugridge, and his behaviour and carriage were insufferable as he showed me my duties.</p></div> </div>
