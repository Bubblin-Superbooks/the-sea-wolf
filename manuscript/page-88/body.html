<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I had always conceived a burial at sea to be a very solemn and awe-inspiring event, but I was quickly disillusioned, by this burial at any rate.&nbsp; One of the hunters, a little dark-eyed man whom his mates called &ldquo;Smoke,&rdquo; was telling stories, liberally intersprinkled with oaths and obscenities; and every minute or so the group of hunters gave mouth to a laughter that sounded to me like a wolf-chorus or the barking of hell-hounds.&nbsp; The sailors trooped noisily aft, some of the watch below rubbing the sleep from their eyes, and talked in low tones together.&nbsp; There was an ominous and worried expression on their faces.&nbsp; It was evident that they did not like the outlook of a voyage under such a captain and begun so inauspiciously.&nbsp; From time to time they stole glances at Wolf Larsen, and I could see that they were apprehensive of the man.</p></div> </div>
