<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It should be unnecessary to state, at least to my friends, that I was shocked.&nbsp; Oaths and vile language of any sort had always been repellent to me.&nbsp; I felt a wilting sensation, a sinking at the heart, and, I might just as well say, a giddiness.&nbsp; To me, death had always been invested with solemnity and dignity.&nbsp; It had been peaceful in its occurrence, sacred in its ceremonial.&nbsp; But death in its more sordid and terrible aspects was a thing with which I had been unacquainted till now.&nbsp; As I say, while I appreciated the power of the terrific denunciation that swept out of Wolf Larsen&rsquo;s mouth, I was inexpressibly shocked.&nbsp; The scorching torrent was enough to wither the face of the corpse.&nbsp; I should not have been surprised if the wet black beard had frizzled and curled and flared up in smoke and flame.&nbsp; But the dead man was unconcerned.</p></div> </div>
