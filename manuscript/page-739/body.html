<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; When I had dressed and opened the door, I heard the waves still lapping on the beach, garrulously attesting the fury of the night.&nbsp; It was a clear day, and the sun was shining.&nbsp; I had slept late, and I stepped outside with sudden energy, bent upon making up lost time as befitted a dweller on Endeavour Island.</p><p>And when outside, I stopped short.&nbsp; I believed my eyes without question, and yet I was for the moment stunned by what they disclosed to me.&nbsp; There, on the beach, not fifty feet away, bow on, dismasted, was a black-hulled vessel.&nbsp; Masts and booms, tangled with shrouds, sheets, and rent canvas, were rubbing gently alongside.&nbsp; I could have rubbed my eyes as I looked.&nbsp; There was the home-made galley we had built, the familiar break of the poop, the low yacht-cabin scarcely rising above the rail.&nbsp; It was the Ghost.</p></div> </div>
