<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; So I lowered the big starboard anchor, giving plenty of slack; and by afternoon I was at work on the windlass.</p><p>Three days I worked on that windlass.&nbsp; Least of all things was I a mechanic, and in that time I accomplished what an ordinary machinist would have done in as many hours.&nbsp; I had to learn my tools to begin with, and every simple mechanical principle which such a man would have at his finger ends I had likewise to learn.&nbsp; And at the end of three days I had a windlass which worked clumsily.&nbsp; It never gave the satisfaction the old windlass had given, but it worked and made my work possible.</p></div> </div>
