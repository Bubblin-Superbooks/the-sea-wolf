<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; I noticed they grinned with satisfaction whenever they looked at the Macedonia&rsquo;s smoke, which was rising higher and higher as she approached from the west.</p><p>The five boats went over the side with a rush, spread out like the ribs of a fan, and set a northerly course, as on the preceding afternoon, for us to follow.&nbsp; I watched for some time, curiously, but there seemed nothing extraordinary about their behaviour.&nbsp; They lowered sails, shot seals, and hoisted sails again, and continued on their way as I had always seen them do.&nbsp; The Macedonia repeated her performance of yesterday, &ldquo;hogging&rdquo; the sea by dropping her line of boats in advance of ours and across our course.&nbsp; Fourteen boats require a considerable spread of ocean for comfortable hunting, and when she had completely lapped our line she continued steaming into the north-east, dropping more boats as she went.</p></div> </div>
