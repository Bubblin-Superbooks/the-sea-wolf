<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The wind was favourable, and I had thought to tow them back under sail, but the wind baffled, then died away, and our progress with the oars was a snail&rsquo;s pace.&nbsp; And it was such dispiriting effort.&nbsp; To throw one&rsquo;s whole strength and weight on the oars and to feel the boat checked in its forward lunge by the heavy drag behind, was not exactly exhilarating.</p><p>Night began to fall, and to make matters worse, the wind sprang up ahead.&nbsp; Not only did all forward motion cease, but we began to drift back and out to sea.&nbsp; I struggled at the oars till I was played out.&nbsp; Poor Maud, whom I could never prevent from working to the limit of her strength, lay weakly back in the stern-sheets.&nbsp; I could row no more.&nbsp; My bruised and swollen hands could no longer close on the oar handles.</p></div> </div>
