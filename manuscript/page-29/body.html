<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; Later,&mdash;how much later I have no knowledge,&mdash;I came to myself with a start of fear.&nbsp; I was alone.&nbsp; I could hear no calls or cries&mdash;only the sound of the waves, made weirdly hollow and reverberant by the fog.&nbsp; A panic in a crowd, which partakes of a sort of community of interest, is not so terrible as a panic when one is by oneself; and such a panic I now suffered.&nbsp; Whither was I drifting?&nbsp; The red-faced man had said that the tide was ebbing through the Golden Gate.&nbsp; Was I, then, being carried out to sea?&nbsp; And the life-preserver in which I floated?&nbsp; Was it not liable to go to pieces at any moment?&nbsp; I had heard of such things being made of paper and hollow rushes which quickly became saturated and lost all buoyancy.&nbsp; And I could not swim a stroke.&nbsp; And I was alone, floating, apparently, in the midst of a grey primordial vastness.</p></div> </div>
