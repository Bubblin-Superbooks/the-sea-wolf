<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; For all the world like a woman wringing her hands, he raised his clenched fists and groaned.&nbsp; One fist unclosed, and the open palm swept across his eyes as though brushing away cobwebs.</p><p>&ldquo;God!&nbsp; God!&rdquo; he groaned, and the clenched fists were raised again to the infinite despair with which his throat vibrated.</p><p>It was horrible.&nbsp; I was trembling all over, and I could feel the shivers running up and down my spine and the sweat standing out on my forehead.&nbsp; Surely there can be little in this world more awful than the spectacle of a strong man in the moment when he is utterly weak and broken.</p></div> </div>
