<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I awoke, oppressed by a mysterious sensation.&nbsp; There seemed something missing in my environment.&nbsp; But the mystery and oppressiveness vanished after the first few seconds of waking, when I identified the missing something as the wind.&nbsp; I had fallen asleep in that state of nerve tension with which one meets the continuous shock of sound or movement, and I had awakened, still tense, bracing myself to meet the pressure of something which no longer bore upon me.</p><p>It was the first night I had spent under cover in several months, and I lay luxuriously for some minutes under my blankets (for once not wet with fog or spray), analysing, first, the effect produced upon me by the cessation of the wind, and next, the joy which was mine from resting on the mattress made by Maud&rsquo;s hands.</p></div> </div>
