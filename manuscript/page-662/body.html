<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&nbsp; The boat was leaping and pounding as it fell over the crests, I could hear the seas rushing past, and spray was continually being thrown aboard.&nbsp; And still, it was not a bad night, I mused&mdash;nothing to the nights I had been through on the Ghost; nothing, perhaps, to the nights we should go through in this cockle-shell.&nbsp; Its planking was three-quarters of an inch thick.&nbsp; Between us and the bottom of the sea was less than an inch of wood.</p><p>And yet, I aver it, and I aver it again, I was unafraid.&nbsp; The death which Wolf Larsen and even Thomas Mugridge had made me fear, I no longer feared.&nbsp; The coming of Maud Brewster into my life seemed to have transformed me.&nbsp; After all, I thought, it is better and finer to love than to be loved, if it makes something in life so worth while that one is not loath to die for it.</p></div> </div>
